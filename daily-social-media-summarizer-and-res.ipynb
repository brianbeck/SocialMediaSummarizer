    "# Daily Social Media Summarizer and Research Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The average person uses [6.83 social media platform each month](https://datareportal.com/social-media-users) with the amount of people regularly getting their news from social media sites [continuing to grow](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we conslidate, summarize, and filter social media news in a single place to enable users to quickly understand what is happening and ask questions for further clarification, bringing in additional authoritative data sources? \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, is it possible to filter search results based on sentiment.  For example, can a user filter out negative news stories if they want to see positive news only and can we fine-tune the model to the user's preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Persona:\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet users of all backgrounds who get their news from social media services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can build an an application which leverage LLM technology that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pulls news from subscribed social media sites on a daily basis\n",
    "3. Classifies the returned news stories based on sentiment\n",
    "4. Creates embeddings for the news stories and stores it in a vector database with the classification metadata\n",
    "5. Create a summary for the user of news stories in the past 24 hours meeting, filtering for negative sentiment\n",
    "6. Allows the user to query for more information on the news stories, while providing grounding when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "I demonstrate this possible solution in this notebook by :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the Reddit API to pull submissions from the past day\n",
    "2. Categorizing the returned submissions based on sentiment\n",
    "3. Creating embeddings for the submissions and store them in a vetor database with their metadata\n",
    "4. Search a vector database for all positive submissions in the past day which don't have negative sentiment and return an summary of the posts\n",
    "5. Allow the user to further ask questions.  These questions can span the social media posts in RAG or use grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts Utilized From the Course Include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompting - Role prompting, System prompting, one-shot, and few-shot prompting\n",
    "2. Structured Output\n",
    "3. Fine Tuning\n",
    "4. Embeddings\n",
    "5. RAG\n",
    "6. Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences / Expansion from the course material:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I used an LLM to create synthetic training and test data to fine tune a model.\n",
    "2. I classify submissions and add this metadata when inserting the document embeddings into the vector database\n",
    "3. I added extensive metadata for the document embeddings stored in the vector database\n",
    "4. I perform queries on the vector database using constraints based on the metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### FAQ:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is RAG important in this use case?\n",
    "I want to provide the user the capability to summarize and search social media submission across all of their social media networks. This enables them to subscribe to content specific to their interests and see this content in one place. "

It includes notifications about being ahead of schedule and how much earlier you could retire. I've also included net worth if you were to continue investing. I'm going to continue tweaking this over time and add features.   There are no ads, and I don’t plan to add any for now. For transparency, I’ve included a “Buy me a coffee” link.
